🌟 Excited to Share My Latest Project: Child Abuse Data Analysis Dashboard! 🌟

I have successfully completed the Module Clearence Test (MCT) to of Module First as a Part of Geekster Data Analysis Course.

In the pursuit of improving child welfare, I have developed a comprehensive Child Abuse Data Analysis Dashboard that provides critical insights into child care and abuse metrics across various states.

🔍 Project Overview:

This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for stakeholders in child welfare, including policymakers, social workers, and advocacy groups, enabling them to make data-driven decisions to protect vulnerable children.

Key Features:

This visualization highlights states that offer the most legal support for children, ensuring their rights are safeguarded.

🔽 Funnel Chart: Top 5 Perpetrator States

This chart illustrates the states with the highest reported cases of perpetrators, allowing for targeted interventions where they are most needed.

📈 Column Chart: Top 6 States with Highest Parents

Showcasing the states with the most significant number of parents, this chart helps inform outreach and resource allocation to support families effectively.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
